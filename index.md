### Frontend Software Development / Medical Device R&D

- I worked in medical device R&D for three years and successfully launched a cardiovascular implant that saves lives. However, the medtech industry was falling behing in adopting new technologies so I decided to take it upon myself to pivot and take up a tech stack so that I may take part in modernizing healthcare and medical devices from the tech side.
