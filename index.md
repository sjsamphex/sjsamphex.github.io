# Frontend/Full Stack Software Development / Medical Device R&D

I worked in medical device R&D for three years, and I successfully launched a cardiovascular implant that saves lives. However, the medtech industry was falling behind in adopting new technologies so I decided to take it upon myself to pivot and take up a tech stack so that I may take part in modernizing healthcare and medical devices from the tech side.

### JavaScript NERP stack: Node, Express, React, PostgresSQL

# Software Development

## Manhattan Trail - Manhattan Food themed Web App of Oregon Trail

### Front End

- Google Maps API to follow Player's journey through Manhattan
- React/Material UI, Redux store management, React Router for page management
- User authorization is persisted with local storage use of JWT Token
- User can log in via GitHub OAuth2 API
- Game is persistent for a user across browsers, phones

### Back End

- Node/Express for RESTful API, Sequelize for ORM with PostgreSQL database
- Multirelational database management designed to scale with users, routes, game state, and multiple minigames
- User Authorization via JWT in header authorization tokens and bcrypt for passwords

### Deployment

- Deployed on Heroku with postgres db and secret keys for OAuth, JWT

### API Connections

- In 5 days, hooked up a barcode scanner, food product lookup API, and openFDA query to collect registered recalls for food products the user can scan personally on desktop and mobile.
- Users can see previously scanned products and whether they were recalled
